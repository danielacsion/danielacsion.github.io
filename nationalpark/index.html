                    <p>Bears are large mammals that eat mostly
                        meat and fish. Many bears also eat plants,
                        bulbs, and insects.
                        The polar bear eats mostly meat and is
                        classified as carnivores, while the panda feeds
                        almost entirely on bamboo and is classified as
                        a herbivore. The six other species of bear eat
                        both plants and animals and are classified as
                        omnivorous.</p>
